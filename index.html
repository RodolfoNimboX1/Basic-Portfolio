<p1> Analytical, creative, multi-disciplinary, agile, focused. I graduated from a Bachelor´s in Marketing but ever since I entered the digital marketing
    area, I found that in order to deliver the best business solutions you need to be more than just a marketer. I consider myself a Growth Hacker. 
    My goal as a growth hacker is to help e-commerce and start-ups to scale and grow their business. With the use of creative marketing, data analysis 
    and process automation we can generate explosive results!
<br>
<br>
Im currently the Customer Success Manager for Nimbo, a Software as a Service for physicians. In the past year, with the help and coordination of the <br>
marketing and sales team, we increased sales x20 times and made it from red numbers to green numbers. <br></p1>
<br>
<p2>I´ve also worked with another great SaaS company, SkyDrop- a logistics enterprise. With them I worked as a Customer Success Manager to keep customers happy, <br>
with Sales to increase the effectivnes and traction of deals, as a Project Manager for an App, and as an Acquisition Expert for Human Resources. <br>
<br>
I also started a small e-commerce site, PawBasket, to deliver a unique experience for new owners of puppies. The objective of PawBasket was to <br>
deliver baskets with all the necessary items to raise a puppy in it´s most important stages.
